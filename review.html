        <h2>The End of the Venom Trilogy</h2>
        <h3>Release Date: October 25, 2025</h3>

        <p>This is dedicated to my fellow alien fans...<br><br>
           After waiting for 3 years, our favorite Marvel duo are back! There have been plenty of theories of how this movie would play out, but believe me when I say that the ending was not what I had in mind. It actually took me a year to finally watch the movie since it was released in 2025 in the cinemas in my country. Sometimes I wished I didn't watched it at all, because I still could not accept the fact that Venom sacrificed himself again for Eddie. Overdramatic? Maybe, but since they basically were on a road trip together while hiding from the authorities and alien huntress, I had an expectation that it wouldn't end in a tragedy and would just be Eddie and Venom's cute moments together. I was stupid. I'm even more stupid for ugly-crying at the fact that Venom wanted to form a family with Eddie and that he wanted to travel to NYC to meet Lady Liberty with him. But enough of the angst, let's also talk about the other symbiotes!<br><br>
           If you have seen the trailers or spoilers, you'd notice that other symbiotes, who appeared on Earth with Venom, will also have different abilities. This would've been helpful in defeating the alien huntress, Xenophage, but was ultimately useless against her. A bummer, truly. In conclusion, I would rate the movie 8/10. Wished there would've been more information about the other symbiotes and actually make an effort on the entire plot. It feels a little bit rushed, to be honest. I've heard from Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel that this film would be Venom and Eddie's last film together. Though I know that Venom will come back somehow in the future, it won't be the same as before.<br><br>
            Thank you, Tom Hardy. For bringing your characters to life and for giving us this heart-aching ending.</p>

            <h5>Exclusively on Wattpad: release date unknown</h5>
            <p>As a writer, the movie had given me an inspiration to write my own sequel to the movie. I'm still developing the story's plot and characters but if ever I'll finally come to a decision, I'll send my Wattpad account for you, dear fans, to open the website or app for any updates.</p>

            <h2>Crossover with Spiderman</h2>
            <p>I've seen many fans looking forward to their crossover, and I admit, it would be cool to watch two of my favorite Marvel characters meet.<br>But I also thought it wouldn't end well since Spidey is basically Venom's ex. I'm sure Vee wouldn't be happy to meet him again, so let's keep our fantasies to ourselves, alright, fans?</p>
